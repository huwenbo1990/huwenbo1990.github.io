                <center><h1>Blender VS 3D Max</h1></center>
				<center><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEH8mUPaGYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
                <p class="lead">While Blender may not be a 3D application you’re as familiar with, and is definitely not one that’s found its way into big name studios it’s still an extremely powerful 3D program. When it comes to strictly asset creation Blender has found its way into the hearts of many indie game developers and hobbyists.</p>
				<p class="lead">One of the best elements of Blender is its modeling tools. While all three applications have the capabilities of creating the same asset, Blender is known to have a very intuitive and easy to understanding modeling workflow. If you’re getting a 3D application strictly for asset creation then Blender can be a great option.</p>
				<p class="lead">Of course, Blender has the full capabilities you’d find in any 3D application like rigging, texturing and animation. It also has a built-in game engine. Now, this game engine is definitely not amazing, but it still makes it very easy to quickly prototype ideas directly in the 3D application.</p>
				<p class="lead">Blender also has a huge community of Blender enthusiasts and game developers so you’ll have lots of avenues for support.</p>
				<p class="lead">Unlike the other two 3D programs, Blender has no sticker price at all. That’s right, it’s a completely free 3D application! This is one of the main reasons why it’s an extremely popular program among smaller game development studios. If you’re on a very tight budget, then Blender is definitely a smart choice.</p>
				<p class="lead">There are a lot of things that go into asset creation, luckily for you all three of these 3D programs have the capabilities of achieving what you need to accomplish. There’s no right or wrong choice, and choosing one can really come down to personal preference or your budget. </p>
